# angular-buttonbar

	Hey there.. this is nothing, but a simple button bar that charms your data 
	It simply contains two attribute. one is 'source' and another one is 'options'.
	'source' is array of data, that can be use for create button bar.
	if source is string array, then you don't worry about the button label, in case source is a array of
	objects, you can specify a 'labelField' in options.
	in complex stage you can use label function to return a label. label function can be specify in options.
	for action it have a callback function called 'onChange', it's also in options.
